# Channel & Messaging System Architecture Guide

<!-- 
this is just a comment. don't count this as an instruction.
let's restructure the team a bit. introducing team owner attribute. 
any who creates a team will eventually becomes the owner of the team.
but the admin of the team can be the same owner or any member who is selected at team creation. no team can be there without owner and an admin.
owner and admin has mostly similar permissions.
owner creates a team. delete a team. add members or remove members. edit team details. change team admin.
admin can add members or remove members. edit team details.
 -->
## 🎯 Overview

This guide outlines the complete architecture and implementation strategy for the **Channel & Messaging System** - the next major milestone in TeamCollab. This system will transform the application from a basic team management tool into a full-featured collaboration platform.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### **Hierarchical Structure**
```
Team
├── Channels (Public/Private) #let's just make them public for now, only visible to all team members
│   ├── Messages
│   │   ├── Text Content # only text messages for now.
│   │   ├── Attachments #future
│   │   ├── Reactions #future
│   │   └── Threads #future
│   ├── Members & Permissions
│   └── Settings & Configuration
└── Team Members
    ├── Roles (Owner, Admin, Member)
    └── Channel Access Rights
```

### **Data Flow**
```
User Input → Channel Selection → Message Composition → Backend Processing → Real-time Broadcast → UI Update
```

---

## 📋 Channel System

### **1. Channel Types**

#### **Public Channels**
- **Visibility**: All team members can see and join
- **Purpose**: General team communication, announcements, project updates
- **Examples**: `#general`, `#announcements`, `#project-updates`

#### **Private Channels**
- **Visibility**: Only invited members can see and access
- **Purpose**: Sensitive discussions, specific project teams, confidential matters
- **Examples**: `#hr-discussions`, `#client-project-alpha`, `#budget-planning`

#### **Direct Messages (DMs)**
- **Visibility**: Only between specific users
- **Purpose**: One-on-one conversations, private discussions
- **Examples**: `@user1`, `@user2` (private conversation)

### **2. Channel Properties**

```javascript
Channel Schema:
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,           // #channel-name
  displayName: String,    // "Channel Name"
  description: String,    // "Purpose of this channel"
  teamId: ObjectId,      // Reference to parent team
  type: String,          // "public", "private", "dm"
  createdBy: ObjectId,   // User who created the channel
  members: [ObjectId],   // Array of user IDs with access
  permissions: {
    canPost: [ObjectId],     // Who can post messages
    canManage: [ObjectId],   // Who can manage channel
    canInvite: [ObjectId]    // Who can invite others
  },
  settings: {
    allowThreads: Boolean,    // Enable message threading
    allowReactions: Boolean,  // Enable emoji reactions
    allowPinning: Boolean,   // Enable message pinning
    slowMode: Number         // Seconds between messages (0 = disabled)
  },
  pinnedMessages: [ObjectId], // Array of pinned message IDs
  lastActivity: Date,         // Last message timestamp
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### **3. Channel Creation Process**

#### **Step 1: Channel Creation Request**
1. User clicks "Create Channel" button
2. Form opens with channel configuration options
3. User fills in:
   - Channel name (with # prefix)
   - Display name (human-readable)
   - Description
   - Channel type (public/private)
   - Initial members (optional)

#### **Step 2: Validation & Creation**
1. **Frontend Validation**:
   - Channel name format (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores)
   - Name uniqueness within team
   - Required field validation

2. **Backend Processing**:
   - Check user permissions (team member + channel creation rights)
   - Validate channel name uniqueness
   - Create channel record
   - Add creator as channel admin
   - Add initial members if specified

#### **Step 3: Channel Activation**
1. Channel appears in team's channel list
2. Real-time notification to team members
3. Channel becomes immediately accessible
